#  Vehicle, Owner & Insurance Identity Management Platform

##  Overview

This project implements a lightweight **Vehicle Identity & Authorization Platform** designed to answer one core business question:

> **Is this vehicle allowed to interact with our connected-vehicle services right now?**

The system evaluates:

*  Vehicle identity
*  Ownership status
*  Insurance coverage (including connected-services eligibility and validity window)

It acts as a **mini authorization gateway** in front of a connected-vehicle ecosystem, deciding whether to allow or block vehicle access based on identity and policy rules.

---

##  Architecture

The solution is built using:

* **Node.js**
* **Express.js**
* Static **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend
* In-memory data registry (no database required)

### High-Level Design

The system consists of:

1. **Backend Service (Express)**

   * Maintains identity registry in memory
   * Runs authorization logic
   * Exposes REST APIs

2. **Frontend UI**

   * Displays registry data
   * Runs authorization checks
   * Allows live creation and updates of vehicles and policies

---

## 🔎 Authorization Logic

When a request is made to verify a vehicle, the backend performs the following checks:

1. **Vehicle Lookup**

   * Accepts `vehicleId`, `VIN`, or `plateNumber`
   * If not found → Blocked

2. **Vehicle Status**

   * Must be `active`

3. **Owner Validation**

   * Owner must exist
   * Owner must be `active`

4. **Insurance Validation**

   * At least one policy must:

     * Be `active`
     * Be within validity dates
     * Cover connected services

###  If all checks pass:

```
authorized = true
reason = "All checks passed."
```

###  If any check fails:

```
authorized = false
reasons = detailed list of failures
```

The response includes:

* Vehicle details
* Owner details
* All linked policies
* Currently valid policies

This makes the decision process transparent and auditable.

##  API Endpoints

###  GET `/api/registry`

Returns all:

* Owners
* Vehicles
* Insurance policies

---

###  POST `/api/vehicles/upsert`

Creates or updates a vehicle.

Requirements:

* At least one of VIN or Plate Number
* If ID exists → update
* If new → create

---

###  POST `/api/policies/upsert`

Creates or updates an insurance policy.

Requirements:

* `vehicleId`
* `policyNumber`

---

###  POST `/api/verify`

Verifies authorization.

Accepts:

* `vehicleId`
* `vin`
* `plateNumber`

Returns:

* `authorized` (true/false)
* `reasons`
* `details`

This is the main authorization gateway endpoint.

###  Fully Compliant Vehicle

* Active vehicle
* Active owner
* Valid active policy covering connected services
  → Result: **Authorized**

---

###  Suspended Policy

* Policy status = suspended
  → Result: **Blocked**

---

###  Expired Policy

* validTo date in the past
  → Result: **Blocked**

---

###  Add New Vehicle Without Insurance

→ Blocked

Add valid policy →
→ Authorization switches to **Authorized**

##  How To Run (Windows + VS Code)

###  Install Node.js

Check installation:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If not installed, download from:
[https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

###  Install Dependencies

In VS Code terminal:

```
npm install
```

---

###  Start Server

```
npm start
```

You should see:

```
Server listening on port 3000
```

---

###  Open Browser

Navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

###  Stop Server

Press:

```
CTRL + C
```
